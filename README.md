# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project consisted of merging 2 CSV files of data collected by PyBer, a ride-share company. After merging the files, a thorough analysis of fare costs, driver counts, and their averages by city type was to be conducted.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to successfully merge two sets of data containing ride and city data, combine them, then extract and calculate a number of factors and categorize them by city type. The newly calculated data was then laid out in a series of dataframes, while total fare costs were compiled and shown by week in a multi-line graph. This will make the merged data readable and understandable to the client and only provide what they need in order to assist them in making sound decisions regarding their company. 

## Outcomes and Analysis

The summary data frame (shown here) are the key metrics that were calculated and summarized into a readable dataframe.

### Rural City Type
- In the Rural city type, by far, there were the least amount of rides and drivers totaled, 125 and 78, respectively. Additionally, it also brought in the least amount of total fare with $4,327.93 accumulated. However, this city type did manage to score the greatest Average Fare per Ride with $34.62 and the greatest Average Fare per Driver, $55.49.

### Suburban City Type
- The Suburban city type fell in the middle of the three surveyed city types on all categories. It was calculated to have had 625 Total Rides and a Total Driver count of 490. It also pulled in a Total Fare amount of $19,356.33. The Suburban city type was shown to have an Average Fare per Ride of $30.97 and an Average Fare per Driver of $39.50.

### Urban City Type
- The Urban city type by far had the most rides with a total of 1,625, the most drivers totaling 2,405, and the greatest Total Fare amount with $39,854.38. However, it fell very short in the amounts of the Averages per Ride and Driver. The Average Fare per Ride totaled only $24.53 and the Average Fare per Driver, $16.57.

## PyBer Analysis Summary
From the data that has been shown, the disparities between the three city types are apparent. There are a few recommendations that could be suggested in order to address these disparities.
    - In the Rural city data, the averages of the fares per ride and driver seem to suggest that the rides are much longer in duration because of a longer distance. This can render the existing drivers unavailable to new demand for long periods of time. It may be within the best interest of the company to to increase the amount of drivers so as to avoid any loss of revenue during possible peaks in business.
    - Similarly, it may be a good decision to consider things like premiums or surge pricing for the rural city type that would drive revenue during peak business times or even during inclement types of weather. 
    - Additionally, creating marketing campaigns targeting drivers from urban and suburban areas to head to rural areas during peak times can aid in urban and suburban drivers receiving the greater averages per driver that rural drivers are getting, as well as aid in any peak of business and drive additional revenue for the rural areas.
